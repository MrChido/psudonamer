# psudonamer
A silly psudoname generator. 

For Christmas (thats what it was called when i was a kid, so thats how it naturealy feels to call it) I recieved a book;
Impractical Python Projects. The book claims to be intermdiate level programs, but this is the first one out of the book.

Its not that complicated, it prints random words from lists forming a first name, nickname, last name combination. Then, it asks to contiue or not.

It also introduced me to Pylint, something I have never encourtered before as a suplementary program before, the score stands at -5/10.(I am comfortable with that)

anyways, if you want to add to the list of possible words go ahead fork it add, and do a merge request. Lets make this one super silly!
    Mr. Chido (No, that was not created by this python program, It's a Yu-Gi-Oh thing)
